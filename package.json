  "description": "Siva Prasanth Sivakumar \r Dr. Katherine Herbert-Berger \r CSIT555 Database Systems \r Objective:  \r WeatherSafe: Real-time Extreme Weather Alert System \r To build a simple real-time data pipeline that retrieves real-time weather data from the \r Natural Weather Services, processes it, and stores it in a database. Subscribe to NOAA \r Weather Radio and national weather media APIs such as AccuWeather and CNN \r Weather and use machine learning models to forecast extreme weather events like \r hurricanes, tornados, and storms in the userâ€™s locality, then display the warning. In \r addition to extreme weather alerts, the live weather and hourly prediction for the rest of \r the day will be displayed. \r Area of Focus: Database and AI Integration in Weather Forecasting: \r Database Management and Data Modeling: \r The core of the system will involve managing large amounts of real-time weather \r data. An efficient data model will be designed to support rapid data retrieval. The \r data will be modeled to handle both structured data from NOAA for general \r weather data and unstructured data from news media sources for extreme weather \r alerts. \r Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Analytics: \r AI integration will enable the system to perform real-time predictive analysis of \r both extreme weather events and normal weather conditions. By leveraging \r machine learning algorithms, the system will: \r Extreme Weather Prediction: Analyze patterns and risk factors to forecast \r extreme weather, providing early warnings. \r Normal Weather Forecasting: When no extreme weather is detected, the \r system will provide regular weather predictions for the rest of the day, \r offering users accurate and timely updates on temperature, precipitation, \r and wind conditions. \r Project Overview: \r Data Sources: \r Fetch Live weather data from National Weather Services from the National Oceanic and \r Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for live weather and weather forecasts. \r Monitor NOAA Weather Radio, National Weather Services (NWS) Alerts, and National \r media outlets like AccuWeather, CNN Weather for extreme weather alerts. \r User Interface: \r Prompt the user for permission to access their GPS information to check for any extreme \r weather in their local Providence. \r Create a search bar where the user can search for extreme weather alerts in different \r locations. \r Display a tab for clothing recommendations based on weather \r Warning System: A three-stage color-coded warning system based on the predicted damage the \r extreme weather will cause and the estimated time for the extreme weather to reach the user's \r location.  \r Green: If the extreme weather is predicted to cause little to no damage.  \r Display:  \r No extreme weather continues to weather forecast \r Yellow: If extreme weather is predicted to cause inconvenience to the user, such as roads, \r schools, and offices being closed for a limited time. Enough damage to take caution but \r not enough to relocate.  \r Display:  \r The Type of extreme weather.  \r How to take caution against extreme weather \r Red: If the extreme weather is predicted to cause serious life-threatening damage. For \r example, strong weather is predicted to cause structural damage to houses and working \r spaces.  \r Send daily notifications until the extreme weather passes the user's locality. \r Display:  \r The Type of extreme weather. \r If the users has time to safely relocate and if relocation is worth the risk of \r exposing the user to the elements: \r The User will receive a list of important things the user should take with them:  \r Their families and friends. \r Government-issued IDs: driving license, passport. \r Important documents: house deed, and etc.  \r Enough funds to wait out the extreme weather. \r If not, The users will receive a list of possible shelters the user can go to be safe. \r When on Red, all the following resources will be open to the users: \r Google Maps: https://www.google.com/maps/ \r Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): https://www.fema.gov/ \r Info to prepare & respond to emergency from FEMA: https://www.ready.gov/  \r To request relief services from the Red Cross: https://www.redcross.org/  \r Weather Based Clothing recommendations: \r Use the existing data source such s NOAA, AccuWeather to get temperature, precipitation, and \r wind conditions and match these weather conditions with a list of appropriate clothing. \r Database for clothing: create a database with different kinds of clothing with metadata of \r temperature range, wind resistance, and waterproofing.",
